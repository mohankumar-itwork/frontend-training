    <!--CSS Flex Model  
    It is a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container.
    Flexbox can be useful for creating small-scales layouts & is responsive and mobile-friendly.
    There are 2 main components of the flexbox model:
     1. flex container: The parent - div Which contains various of divisions is called a flex container.
     2. flex items: The items inside the container-div are flex items. 
    
    flex container
    1. flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
    2. flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse
    3. flex-flow: <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>
    4. justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly
    5. align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch
    6. align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | stretch
    7. order: <number>
    8. flex-grow: <number>
    9. flex-shrink: <number> 
    10. flex-basis: <length> | auto
    11. flex: none | <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>
    12. align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch    
    -->

    <!-- flex-direction: 
    The flex-direction property defines the which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.
     .container {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
    }
    flex-wrap:
    By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. you can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
    .container {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
    }
    flex-flow:
    This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container's main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.
    .container {
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: column wrap;
    }
    justify-content:
    The justify-content property defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space
    .container {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;
    }
    align-items:
    The align-items property defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross
    .container {
        display: flex;
        align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end | safe | unsafe;
    }
    align-content:
    The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.
    .container {
        display: flex;
        align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | stretch | start | end | self-start | self-end | safe | unsafe;
    }
        flex items
    1. order: <number>
        the order property specifies the order of the flex items.
        The first flex item in the code does not have to appear as the first item in the layout.
        The order value must be a number, default value is 0.
    2. flex-grow: <number>
        This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary.
        If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children.
        If one of the children has a value of 2, that child will take twice as much of the remaining space as the others (or it will try to).
        .item {
            flex-grow: 1 | 2 | 3 ...; // default is 0
        }
    3. flex-shrink: <number>
        This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
        .item {
            flex-shrink: 1 | 2 | 3 ...; // default is 1
        }
    4. flex-basis: <length> | auto
        this defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
        .item {
            flex-basis: auto | 20% | 10rem | ...; // default is auto
        }
    5. flex: none | <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>
        The flex property is a shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties combined.
        .item {
            flex: none | 1 1 auto | 2 0 10% | ...; // default is 0 1 auto
        }
    6. align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
        This allows the default alignement (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.
        .item {
            align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch; // default is auto
        }
